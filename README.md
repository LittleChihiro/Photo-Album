# Development of an Image Database for Website Projects

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a platform that simplifies the uploading, searching, and managing of images for web projects. It is designed to help clients and advertising agencies efficiently organize their images, saving time and optimizing their workflow. The platform offers quick image search capabilities, straightforward management options, and detailed image information to enhance productivity.

## Background

In managing and organizing images for web projects, we've found no suitable application that meets all user needs. Current systems lack in several areas; they often make searching cumbersome, image management cluttered, and they lack essential information about the images, such as file size or copyright details.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a user-friendly solution that provides efficient search functionality, clear management, comprehensive image details, and extensive copyright information. The aim is to create a system that not only recognizes the current issues but also effectively resolves them.

## Project Goals

The objective of this project is to develop a specialized platform tailored to simplify the challenges of storing, searching, and managing images for web projects for clients and external service providers.

- **Efficient Image Search:** The platform will feature a powerful search function that allows users to quickly and accurately find images based on categories, date, names, image versions, or the status of the images. This significantly boosts productivity by reducing the time spent searching for images.

- **Image Status Management:** Users can individually set the status of each image, whether it be “New,” “Released,” “Edited,” etc. This function is crucial for streamlining the workflow throughout the editing process.

- **Comprehensive Image Information:** The platform will provide detailed information for each image, including file size, last modification date, metadata, as well as source and licensing information. This enables users to make informed decisions when selecting images for their projects.

- **User Control and Privacy:** The platform ensures that each user has access only to their uploaded images and folders, adhering to data protection regulations and ensuring data security.

- **Administrator Access:** As an administrator, I maintain control over all images and folders, enabling efficient management and monitoring of the platform.

## Website Structure

The web application comprises several key pages, each serving a distinct function within the platform:

- **Home Page (`home.html`):** Welcomes users to the platform, offering links to explore photos, sign up, or log in, catering to both new visitors and returning users.

- **Login and Signup (`signup.html`):** Facilitate user authentication, crucial for personalizing the experience and ensuring data privacy.

- **Profile (`profile.html`) and Edit Profile (`edit_profile.html`):** Allow users to view and edit their profiles, supporting user control and customization.

- **Photo Detail (`photo.html`):** Displays detailed information about each photo, aligning with the goal of providing comprehensive image data.

- **Gallery (`gallery.html`):** Acts as the central hub for users to browse, view, and manage their image collection efficiently, supporting the efficient image search and status management objectives.

- **Add Photo (`add.html`):** Enables users to upload new images, potentially categorizing them, which aligns with the platform's aim for efficient image management and organization.
